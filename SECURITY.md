# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Currently, we are only accepting security vulnerabilities and suggestions for the latest stable release. Should any other vulnerabilities be found, they can be reported, however they may not be actioned upon.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Currently, the only way to report a vulnerability is to raise an issue on the issues page. Make sure to list where in the code the issue can be found and why it needs to be addressed. Should you have any ideas on how to improve the code on this page, feel free to use the discussions page for more in-depth conversations.
